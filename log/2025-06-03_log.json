    "bot": "Based on the provided documents, the key difference between Area of Operation (AO) and Area of Approach (AOA) lies in their spatial organization. \n\nContiguous AO refers to all of a commander’s subordinate forces' AOs sharing one or more common boundaries, with distinctive forward, lateral, and rear boundaries. Units within a contiguous AO are typically within supporting distance of one another. \n\nOn the other hand, Non-Contiguous AO involves one or more of the commander’s subordinate forces' AOs not sharing a common boundary. The areas between the subordinate units remain the responsibility of the battalion. Non-contiguous AOs do not possess distinctive forward, lateral, or rear boundaries, and the AO consists of a boundary that encompasses the whole unit.\n\nTherefore, the main difference between AOA and AO is the spatial relationship between the subordinate units' areas of operation - whether they share common boundaries (contiguous) or do not (non-contiguous)."
